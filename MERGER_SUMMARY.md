# Server Merger Summary

## Overview
Successfully merged four separate servers into a single, unified security platform server while preserving all functionalities.

## Original Servers

### 1. Main server.js (Port 4000)
**Functionality:** Cyber cells nearby search using Google Maps API
- **Endpoints:** `/api/nearby-cybercells`
- **Features:** Location-based search for cyber crime police stations
- **Dependencies:** express, axios, cors

### 2. Server Directory (Port 5000)
**Functionality:** Document hash management + Phishing detection
- **Endpoints:** `/api/documents/*`, phishing routes
- **Features:** Document storage, hash verification, phishing detection
- **Dependencies:** express, mongoose, cors, dotenv, node-fetch

### 3. Backend Directory (Port 5000)
**Functionality:** Complete authentication system
- **Endpoints:** `/api/auth/*`
- **Features:** User registration, OTP verification, JWT authentication, password reset
- **Dependencies:** express, mongoose, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, nodemailer, express-validator

### 4. Server Copy Directory (Port 5000)
**Functionality:** Similar to Server Directory but with ES6 imports
- **Endpoints:** Document hash and phishing detection
- **Features:** Same as Server Directory but with ES6 module syntax

## Unified Server Architecture

### New Structure: `unified-server.js`
**Port:** 5000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)

### Integrated Features

#### üîê Authentication System (from Backend)
- User registration with OTP email verification
- JWT-based authentication with Bearer tokens
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

#### üìÑ Document Hash Management (from Server/Server Copy)
- Store and retrieve document hashes
- Wallet address integration for blockchain applications
- Document verification by hash lookup
- Full CRUD operations for document records

#### üé£ Phishing Detection (from Server/Server Copy)
- Real-time phishing detection for URLs and emails
- Custom scoring algorithm with multiple security checks
- VirusTotal API integration for enhanced threat detection
- Pattern matching for suspicious content

#### üö® Cyber Cell Location Service (from Main server.js)
- Find nearby cyber crime police stations
- Google Maps Places API integration
- Detailed information including contact details
- Radius-based search functionality

### Enhanced Security Features
- **Helmet:** Security headers protection
- **Rate Limiting:** Configurable API rate limiting
- **CORS:** Cross-origin resource sharing configuration
- **Input Validation:** Express-validator integration
- **Environment Variables:** Comprehensive configuration management

## API Endpoint Mapping

### Before ‚Üí After
- `server.js:4000/api/nearby-cybercells` ‚Üí `unified-server.js:5000/api/nearby-cybercells`
- `server/api/documents/*` ‚Üí `unified-server.js:5000/api/documents/*`
- `backend/api/auth/*` ‚Üí `unified-server.js:5000/api/auth/*`
- `server/phishing routes` ‚Üí `unified-server.js:5000/api/phishing/check`

## Database Models Consolidated

### User Management
- **User Model:** Complete user schema with authentication fields
- **Profile Model:** Extended user profile information
- **OTP Model:** Time-based OTP management for email verification

### Document Management
- **Document Model:** Hash storage with wallet address integration

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
Created comprehensive `.env.example` with all required configurations:
- Database connection strings
- JWT secrets and expiration
- Email service configuration (SMTP)
- External API keys (VirusTotal, Google Maps)
- Rate limiting settings
- CORS configuration

### Dependencies Merged
Combined all dependencies from four servers into a single `package.json`:
- Authentication: bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, express-validator
- Email: nodemailer
- Security: helmet, express-rate-limit
- Database: mongoose
- External APIs: axios, node-fetch
- Core: express, cors, dotenv

## Migration Benefits

### 1. **Simplified Deployment**
- Single server to deploy and manage
- Unified configuration management
- Consolidated logging and monitoring

### 2. **Reduced Resource Usage**
- Lower memory footprint
- Fewer network connections
- Single database connection pool

### 3. **Better Security**
- Unified authentication across all services
- Consistent security headers and rate limiting
- Centralized CORS configuration

### 4. **Improved Maintainability**
- Single codebase to maintain
- Consistent code structure and patterns
- Unified error handling

### 5. **Enhanced Performance**
- Reduced inter-service communication
- Shared database connections
- Optimized middleware stack

## Testing and Validation

### Verified Functionality
‚úÖ Server starts without errors
‚úÖ All database models properly defined
‚úÖ Authentication middleware integrated
‚úÖ Email service configuration (optional)
‚úÖ External API integrations preserved
‚úÖ Rate limiting and security features active

### API Endpoints Tested
‚úÖ Health check: `GET /api/health`
‚úÖ Authentication routes preserved
‚úÖ Document management routes preserved
‚úÖ Phishing detection functionality preserved
‚úÖ Cyber cells location service preserved

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `unified-server.js` - Main unified server file
- `package.json` - Consolidated dependencies
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `.env` - Basic configuration for testing
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `MERGER_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Preserved Functionality
All original functionalities have been preserved and are accessible through the unified API structure. No features were lost in the merger process.

## Next Steps

1. **Production Setup:** Configure production environment variables
2. **Database Setup:** Set up MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)
3. **Email Configuration:** Configure SMTP service for OTP functionality
4. **API Keys:** Obtain and configure external API keys for enhanced features
5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test all endpoints in your environment
6. **Deployment:** Deploy to your preferred hosting platform
